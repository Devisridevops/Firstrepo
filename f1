Definition: A kilobyte (symbol: kB) is equal to 103 bytes (1000 bytes), where a byte is a unit of digital information that consists of eight bits (binary digits).

History/origin: The kilobyte is based on the byte, which is derived from the bit, and is a unit that makes use of SI (International System of Units) prefixes. The term byte was coined in 1956 by Werner Buchholz. In 1998, the International Electrotechnical Commission defined new prefixes for the byte to be used in addition to their SI (International System of Units) counterparts, with the intent that the SI prefixes would be used when referencing 1000 bytes. The new prefixes would be used when referencing multiples of 1024 bytes (210), which is the binary definition of bytes used in information technology
